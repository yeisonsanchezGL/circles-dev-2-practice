Implement the Tic Tac Toe web app using plain HTML/CSS/JS (no frameworks), with files index.html, style.css, app.js

Use a Tree-of-Thoughts approach before writing the final code.

Tree-of-Thoughts instructions:

1. Generate multiple design approaches for the game:
   - Board representation
   - Turn handling
   - Win detection
   - AI move logic (simple, intermediate, advanced)

2. For each approach:
   - Briefly evaluate pros and cons
   - Consider simplicity, correctness, and readability

3. Select the best overall approach.

4. Only after selecting the best approach:
   - Implement the full solution as a single HTML file
   - Include minimal but clear comments
   - Ensure the game is playable in the browser without external libraries

Output format:
- First: a short “Decision Summary” explaining which approach was chosen and why
- Second: the complete HTML codeTree-of-Thoughts steps:

1. Generate at least three different implementation strategies:
   - How to structure the HTML board
   - How to style the board (CSS Grid vs Flexbox)
   - How to manage game state in JavaScript
   - How to detect wins and handle turns

2. For each strategy:
   - Briefly analyze advantages and disadvantages
   - Consider readability, maintainability, and simplicity

3. Select the best overall strategy and explain why it was chosen.

4. After selecting the best strategy:
   - Implement the game using a SINGLE HTML file
   - Do not use external libraries or frameworks
   - Ensure the game works by just opening the file in a browser

Output format:
1. "Design Decision Summary" (short)
2. Complete code (HTML + CSS + JS)
