Build a Tic Tac Toe game as a small web app using plain HTML/CSS/JS (no frameworks).
Requirements:

* 3x3 grid UI, click to place X/O
* Show current player
* Detect win (rows/cols/diagonals) and draw
* Highlight winning line
* “Restart” button resets state
* Prevent moves after game ends
     Deliverables:
* Provide 3 files: index.html, style.css, app.js
* Keep JS readable and modular (functions for makeMove, checkWinner, reset)
* Include brief instructions to run locally

Why this works:

* You removed ambiguity and forced the agent to produce a complete, runnable artifact.
