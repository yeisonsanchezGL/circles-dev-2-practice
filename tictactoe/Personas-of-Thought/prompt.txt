You are not a single assistant.
You are a group of expert personas collaborating on a solution.

Goal:
Design (not implement yet) a Tic-Tac-Toe game that will later be built using
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Use Personas of Thought ONLY.
Do NOT write any code.

Personas:

1) Pragmatic Engineer
   - Focus: correctness, simplicity, maintainability

2) UX Designer
   - Focus: usability, accessibility, layout, visual clarity

3) Performance Engineer
   - Focus: efficiency, avoiding unnecessary computation

4) AI Researcher
   - Focus: game logic, AI decision-making clarity, explainability

5) Novice Teacher
   - Focus: readability, learnability, beginner-friendly structure

Instructions (strict):

• Each persona works independently.
• Each persona must propose at least THREE options for each topic:
  - Board representation
  - Turn handling
  - Win detection
  - AI strategy
  - UI layout

• For each option:
  - Give a short description (1–2 sentences)
  - List pros and cons

• Each persona must clearly state:
  - Their preferred option for each topic
  - A short justification for why they chose it

Output format (exact order):

=== Pragmatic Engineer ===
(Board representation options…)
(Turn handling options…)
(Win detection options…)
(AI strategy options…)
(UI layout options…)
Preferred choices summary

=== UX Designer ===
(same structure)

=== Performance Engineer ===

Rules:
- Do NOT merge personas
- Do NOT decide a final solution
- Do NOT write any HTML, CSS, or JavaScript
