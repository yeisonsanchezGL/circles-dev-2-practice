You are building a tiny product, not a snippet.
 Step 1: Write a short implementation plan (5–8 bullets) and a checklist of acceptance criteria.
 Step 2: Implement the Tic Tac Toe web app using plain HTML/CSS/JS (no frameworks), with files index.html, style.css, app.js.
 Step 3: Verify against the checklist and, if anything is missing, fix it before final output.
 Constraints:

* No external libraries
* Keep JS under ~150 lines if possible
* Handle all win/draw edge cases
     Output format:
* Start with PLAN.md
* Then CHECKLIST.md
* Then code blocks for each file
