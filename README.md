# Prompting Techniques – Code Examples

This repository contains **code examples and prompt samples** created for learning and practicing different **prompting techniques** used with Large Language Models (LLMs).

The goal of this project is to explore how prompt structure and reasoning strategies can improve the quality, accuracy, and reliability of model outputs.

## 📚 Included Prompting Techniques

The examples in this repository cover techniques such as:

- **Chain of Thought** – Step-by-step reasoning prompts
- **Tree of Thoughts** – Exploring multiple reasoning paths before selecting an answer
- **Persona Thoughts** – Prompting the model to reason from a specific role or perspective
- **Planning & Self-Check** – Generating a plan and validating the result before answering
- **Few-Shot Prompting** – Guiding the model with examples

Each folder or file focuses on one or more of these techniques, with clear examples you can adapt for your own use cases.

## 🤖 Prompt Generation

All prompts included in this repository were **generated with the help of ChatGPT** and are intended for **educational and experimental purposes**.

They are not meant to represent best practices for every scenario, but rather to serve as:
- Learning references
- Experimentation starting points
- Inspiration for building your own prompts

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository is useful if you want to:
- Learn prompt engineering concepts
- Compare different reasoning techniques
- Practice structured prompting
- Understand how prompt design affects model behavior

## 📌 Notes

- These examples may evolve over time as prompting techniques improve.
- Feel free to fork, modify, and experiment.
